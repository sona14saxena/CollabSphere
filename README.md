Introduction

CollabSphere – Where Ideas Meet Talent

CollabSphere is a smart collaboration platform designed to empower students to turn their project ideas into reality by helping them find the right teammates — all based on skills, interests, and verified credibility.

Problem

In colleges, many students have innovative project ideas but struggle to find the right collaborators. There’s no centralized, trusted place to:

- Discover like-minded peers with complementary skills  
- Avoid ghost teammates  
- Build lasting reputations based on actual contribution  

This results in abandoned projects and missed opportunities.

Our Solution

CollabSphere makes it easy to:

-  Post project ideas with open roles (e.g., “Need a backend dev”)
-  Apply to join projects that match your interests and skills
-  Verify your profile via LinkedIn, GitHub, and college email
-  Review and rate teammates post-project to build credibility
